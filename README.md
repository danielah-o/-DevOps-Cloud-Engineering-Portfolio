Cloud Platforms: AWS (EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda), GCP, Azure

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

Containers & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS)

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

Security: IAM, Security Groups, DevSecOps best practices

Automation: Bash, Python, Ansible

Networking: VPCs, Load Balancers, DNS with Route 53
